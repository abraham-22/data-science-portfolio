    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "The purpose of this statistical analysis is to assist in developing a proposal for a new bike-sharing program. To achieve this goal, an analysis was conducted on the NYC CitiBike business data for the month of August to establish baseline information. This baseline data will provide insights into the operational aspects and user behavior of a successful bike-sharing program, which can be used to inform the development of the new program..\n",
